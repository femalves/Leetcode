    "You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to share the chocolate with your K friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into K+1 pieces using K cuts, each piece consists of some consecutive chunks.\n",

    "Being generous, you will eat the piece with the minimum total sweetness and give the other pieces to your friends.\n",

    "Input: sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], K = 5\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
